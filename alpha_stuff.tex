\section{Journal Alpha}

This is an alpha version of the Journal.  Thanks for taking the time to try it and, hopefully, provide feedback so the 2017 version can be great.

Note that the current wire ring binding is alpha only.  The 2017 journal will be bound differently.  Ideas and feature requests (e.g. colors, materials, pockets for keeping notes) are gratefully received.

Please provide feedback as many times as you'd like throughout the year at \url{http://singleton.io/alpha}
